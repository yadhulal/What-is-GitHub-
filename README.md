Repository(repo) - a folder in which all files and their version histories
                                are stored.

 Branch -  a workspace in which you can make changes that won't affect 
                  the live site.

Markdown -  a way to write in github that converts plain text to github code.

Commit Changes - a saved record of changes made to a file within the repo.

Pull Request (PR) - the way to ask for changes made to branch to be merged 
                                  into another branch that also allows for multiple users to 
                                  see,discuss and review work being alone.

Merge -  after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged)
               from one branch to another and then deployed on the live site.
